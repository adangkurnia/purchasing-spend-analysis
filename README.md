# Defining the question
Purchasing is the process a business or organization uses to acquire goods or services to accomplish its goals. This part becomes very important in organizations since it gives businesses a structured way to address their needs. Generally, purchasing covers more than 50 percent of expenses of all the revenues the firm receives as income from sales. Based on that situation, the effective purchasing process can help prevent theft, fraud, or irregular spending since it requires documenting all business transactions.

# Summary
From the analysis, there are several important things that need to be considered in order to increase the good performance of Purchasing spend. Here are the points:
- The total spending in 2022 increased quite significantly compared to the previous year, so it is important to provide a better strategy in 2023 to reduce and avoid unnecessary costs.
- The number of partnership vendors is very quiet, so the main thing to do is to keep or even improve a good relationship with them. To reach that, something that can be done is to identify which suppliers are not only available during your urgent times, but also classify them based on a number of other criteria such as special discounts, reaction time, and other compliance parameters of the contract.
- Since there are various spent by each department, it is very important to set up the future budget for purchasing and make sure that every department will spend their needs wisely.
